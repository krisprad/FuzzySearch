# FuzzySearch

The search is meant for finding strings whcih are not
native latin script but transliterated into one.
The transliteration gives raise to multiple spellings.
Here the focus is on Indian spellings.
The general idea is that similar sounding texts should compare equal which is useful is a large class of applications.
For example, searching for an employee in a large organization but the exact spelling is not known.


eg, take names:

     Andhra Jyothi (name of a Telugu language daily news paper)
     
all these spellings are possible:

   aandhra jyOthi
   
   aandhra jyoti
   
   andra jyoothi (less common)

As an another example, 'Srinivas ' and 'Sreenivas' should compare equal.
