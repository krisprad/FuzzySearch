# FuzzySearch

The search is meant for finding strings whcih are not
native latin script but transliterated into one.
The transliteration gives raise to multiple spellings.
Here the focus is on Indian spellings.

eg, take names:

     Andhra Jyothi (name of a Telugu language daily)
     
all these spellings are possible:

   aandhra jyOthi
   
   aandhra jyoti
   
   andra jyoothi (less common)
